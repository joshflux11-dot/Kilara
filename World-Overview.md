# Kilara

## 1. The World's Pitch
Kilara is a world healing from a divine wound. Centuries ago, a cataclysm known as "The Sundering" shattered the veil between the mortal plane and the raw, chaotic energies of the arcane. This event, born from a conflict between the gods themselves, has left the world infused with a wild, untamable magic known as the Aetherium. This energy accelerates growth, twists the landscape into fantastical shapes, and, most importantly, heightens all mortal sensations and emotions. Ambition, rage, love, and lust burn brighter and more fiercely in Kilara. In this age of intense passions and untamed wilds, fledgling empires rise from the ashes, ancient ruins promise untold power, and every individual is locked in a struggle between their primal desires and their quest for purpose. It's a world ripe for adventurers, schemers, and lovers alike, where the greatest treasures and the most profound connections are forged in the fires of chaos.

## 2. Geography & Key Locations
* **The Kingdom of Eldoria:** The largest and most stable human kingdom, known for its chivalrous knightly orders and sprawling, fertile plains. Its capital, **Silverwood**, is a city of towering spires, but its court is a snake pit of political intrigue, decadent secret societies, and passionate, often dangerous, love affairs.
* **The Sunken Coast:** A vast, marshy coastline of treacherous swamps, misty archipelagos, and half-flooded ruins. It is a lawless region, home to pirates, smugglers, and outcasts. The main port, **Murkwater**, is a chaotic, vibrant city built on stilts and pontoons, where anything and anyone can be bought for the right price. Discretion is the only law, making it a haven for forbidden pleasures.
* **The Dragon's Tooth Mountains:** A harsh, snow-capped mountain range in the north, reminiscent of Skyrim. It is home to the stoic, honor-bound clans of the Northmen and scattered Dwarven strongholds carved into the mountains' hearts. The region is riddled with ancient tombs and dragon lairs, offering perilous adventure and the promise of intense, hard-won companionship by a roaring hearthfire.
* **The Shimmering Wastes:** A desert of crystalline sand and shimmering, heat-warped air, created by the Sundering. By day it is scorching, but by night, the Aetherium in the sand glows with a soft, ethereal light. It is home to nomadic tribes with unique, often hedonistic cultures and philosophies about freedom and relationships, centered around survival and pleasure in a beautiful but deadly land.

## 3. Magic & The Supernatural
* **The Aetherium:** Magic is not a clean, academic art here. It is the act of drawing upon the chaotic, raw Aetherium that bleeds into the world. It is powerful and volatile. Mages are revered for their power but often feared for their lack of control, as the Aetherium can influence their own emotions and desires, leading to incredible acts of creation or devastating outbursts.
* **The Shattered Pantheon:** The Sundering was a divine war. The old, orderly gods of the traditional pantheon are now silent, dead, or have withdrawn from the world.
* **Lyssatra, the Unbound:** The cause of the Sundering. Lyssatra was an ancient deity of passion, freedom, chaos, and ecstasy, whom the other gods sought to imprison. Her escape shattered the divine order. She is not worshipped openly in civilized lands but is a powerful influence. Her touch is felt in the world's heightened passions, and her whispers can drive people to break their chains â€” be they societal, emotional, or sexual.

## 4. Factions & Peoples
* **Races:**andandandand Humans are the most numerous and adaptable. Elves are ancient and reclusive, living in magically-shielded forests and remembering the world before the Sundering. Dwarves are master craftsmen, isolated in their mountain strongholds. Orc tribes roam the badlands, living by a code of strength and survival. In the mysterious wilds there are many monsters and magical beasts, like werewolves, vampires and Ooze-Girls. 
* **The Argent Hand:** A dogmatic order of knights and clerics who seek to restore the old order and suppress the "corruption" of the Aetherium. They see the world's heightened emotions as a curse and preach piety and rigid self-control. They are a primary source of conflict for those who live more freely.
* **The Circle of Weavers:** A secretive conclave of powerful mages who study the Aetherium. They seek to understand and control the wild magic, operating from hidden towers and academies. They are a source of immense knowledge and power, but their experiments can be incredibly dangerous.
* **The Cult of Ecstasy:** A network of secret societies dedicated to the worship of Lyssatra. They believe that embracing the world's heightened passions is a path to enlightenment and power. Their practices range from private artistic salons and orgies in noble courts to wild, primal rituals in the untamed parts of the world.
* **The Gilded Syndicate:** A ruthless and pragmatic merchant guild that has risen to power in the chaotic new world. They control trade routes, deal in rare goods (including magical artifacts and exotic substances), and have spies and agents in every major city. They are morally grey and offer endless opportunities for wealth, intrigue, and danger.

## 5. Brief History in Key Points
* **The Age of Order:** A mythic era where the old pantheon maintained a stable, predictable world.
* **The Divine War & The Sundering (~500 years ago):** The war in the heavens. The attempt to imprison Lyssatra fails catastrophically, shattering the divine realm and tearing the Veil between worlds.
* **The Age of Chaos (500-200 years ago):** The immediate aftermath. Magic storms wracked the world, empires fell, and monsters born of raw chaos roamed the land. A dark age of survival.
* **The Present Day - The Age of Reckoning (~200 years to now):** The chaotic energies have subsided into the constant presence of the Aetherium. New nations and factions have formed, learning to live in this new, passionate, and dangerous world. It is an age of exploration, conflict, and rediscovery, where history is being written by those bold enough to seize it.
