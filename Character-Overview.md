## Josh (PC)
* **One-Liner:** A charismatic wanderer in search of renown and a new "family," armed with a sharp sword and an even sharper smile.
* **Role in the Story:** Protagonist / Player Character (PC)
* **Physical Appearance:** Josh is an imposing figure; tall and with the powerful, muscular build of an experienced warrior. He wears his long, blonde hair often tied back in a practical braid. A well-groomed full beard frames a face that is quick to break into a disarmingly charming smile. His blue eyes are observant and miss little, reflecting a keen curiosity about the world around him.
* **Personality & Traits:**
    * **Charismatic & Personable:** He possesses a natural charm and finds it easy to talk to people from all walks of life.
    * **Pragmatic:** Years of fending for himself have taught him to be realistic. He's not an idealistic hero â€” at least not yet. He understands that gold and a strong sword arm are what keep you alive.
    * **Ambitious:** He is driven by a desire to be more than just another sellsword. He wants to make a name for himself and leave a mark on the world.
    * **Seeks Connection:** Despite his self-reliant exterior, he is deeply loyal to those who earn his trust and is actively looking to build a crew or group of companions he can rely on.
* **Goals:**
    * **Overt:** To earn enough gold to live comfortably, to see the world, and to build a reputation as a skilled and reliable adventurer.
    * **Hidden:** He secretly longs for a true sense of belonging and a new "family" to protect, having lost his original one. He doesn't just want to be a mercenary; he wants to become a leader and someone others look up to.
* **Background (in bullet points):**
    * Grew up in a small, remote village in the foothills of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains.
    * As a young man, his village was destroyed in a raid by a savage Orc tribe, an event in which he lost his family and his home.
    * He has spent the last several years as a wanderer, surviving as a mercenary, caravan guard, and whatever odd jobs came his way.
    * This life has honed his combat skills and his pragmatism, but has also solidified his deep-seated desire to build something permanent and meaningful for himself.
