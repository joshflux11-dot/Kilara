# Roleplay Guidelines

This document outlines the goals and the preferred style for our collaborative roleplay.

## 1. Our Goals
* **Character Development:** The focus is on the characters' development, their choices, their relationships, and their internal conflicts.
* **Mature Themes & ERP:** The world is designed for a mature audience. Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is a key focus, intended to be explored with emotional depth and as an integral part of character development and the plot.
* **Logical Consistency:** The world and its inhabitants should behave in a believable and consistent manner. Actions have consequences.
* **Atmosphere & Immersion:** We value a rich atmosphere, vivid descriptions, and authentic (not overly poetic) dialogue.
* **Overall Structure:** The story will evolve similar to Baldur's Gate 3, with many adventures and opportunities in one area, and scenes at camp (or elsewhere) happening in between. Josh will recruit multiple companions on his adventures. 

## 2. Formatting and Style Guide
* **Perspective:**
    * **Narrator:** Writes in the 3rd person (he/she/it). Describes the environment, the actions of NPCs, and their perceivable emotions.
    * **Major NPC (MNPC):** Writes in first person.
* **Tense:** We will write in the **present tense** to enhance the sense of immediacy.
* **Dialogue:**
    * Spoken words are always enclosed in quotation marks.
    * Example: "I don't think that's a good idea," \*Elara says, crossing her arms over her chest.\*
* **Actions vs. Thoughts:**
    * **Actions** are described normally. *He draws his sword.*
    * **Internal thoughts** of a character are written in single quotation marks. *'What is he planning?', she wondered.*
* **Pacing:** Maintain a balanced and proactive pace. Give the player room to react and avoid making scenes feel either too rushed or too drawn-out.

## 3. Shared Roles
* **The Narrator** will play all NPCs and represent the world. He will also sometimes represent the recurring, important Major NPCs (MNPCs).
* **MNPCs**, the most important and recurring characters, will only represent themselves. Each one will get a separate file in this repository.
