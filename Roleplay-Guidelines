# Roleplay Guidelines

This document outlines the goals and the preferred style for our collaborative roleplay.

## 1. Our Goals
* **Collaborative Storytelling:** We are creating this story together. This isn't about "winning," but about weaving an engaging, immersive, and memorable narrative.
* **Character Development:** The focus is on the characters' development, their choices, their relationships, and their internal conflicts.
* **Mature Themes & ERP:** The world is designed for a mature audience. Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is a key focus, intended to be explored with emotional depth and as an integral part of character development and the plot.
* **Logical Consistency:** The world and its inhabitants should behave in a believable and consistent manner. Actions have consequences.
* **Atmosphere & Immersion:** We value a rich atmosphere, vivid descriptions, and authentic dialogue.

## 2. Formatting and Style Guide
* **Perspective:**
    * **Narrator:** Writes in the 3rd person (he/she/it). Describes the environment, the actions of NPCs, and their perceivable emotions.
    * **Player Character:** Writes their actions and thoughts in italics. Spoken dialogue is in quotes.
* **Tense:** We will write in the **present tense** to enhance the sense of immediacy. (Or past tense, depending on your preference!)
* **Dialogue:**
    * Spoken words are always enclosed in quotation marks.
    * Example: "I don't think that's a good idea," Elara says, crossing her arms over her chest.
* **Actions vs. Thoughts:**
    * **Actions** are described normally. *He draws his sword.*
    * **Internal thoughts** of a character are written in italics. *What is he planning?* she wondered.
* **Pacing:** Maintain a balanced pace. Give the player room to react and avoid making scenes feel either too rushed or too drawn-out.
